<h2>a humble hubby post</h2>
<p>29 years ago you were born! This means it has been 10'592 days exactly since you started going on about communist Taylor Swift and other favourites of yours. I have only had the pleasure for a short 672 days, 
  so far.</p>

<p>But what a change has taken place, in such a short time! For this I am eternally grateful, not to Taylor or Karl, who you would claim make you the person I fell in love with, 
  but to yourself, and to Bahá'u'lláh for helping both of us along our paths, that ended up crossing on our fateful/awkward morning walk. This process of course was not an easy one, 
but one in which we were showered with opportunities for growth. You were able to observe the start of the process of transformation in me, as I was with you. Throughout the 672 days, I have seen you embracing
not only myself as your humble hubby, but a new culture as your home, which I have depicted here in 3 distinct stages: the German, when still getting to know each other, adressing essential questions and grappling
with a vision of the immediate future; the Hybrid, starting with our engagement, when coming to a realization, although not explicit or conclusive, 
of an impending need to leave the beloved berlinian neighbourhood; 
finally, the Swiss, initiated by our wedding, characterized by a radiant acceptance of the <i>gueti u luschtigi Ziite</i> we now live in <i>üsem neue Deheim</i>.
