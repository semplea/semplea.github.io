<h2>a humble hubby post</h2>
<p>Wow! so this is what it's like to prepare a gift for one's wife. Up until now, I've only ever done so for friends, family, and fiancée. The wife-gift-giving experience is different, more intense it seems,
because of a need for secrecy, and a mounting expectations of a wife who keeps on reminding herself and others about the upcoming day for at least 6 weeks beforehand. Anyway, who knows what would have
come out of it, if I hadn't wanted to intensively prepare for my intensely sweet wifey, so in the end, I am grateful!</p>

<br/>
<p>29 years ago you were born! Happy birthday, wifey! 29 years... this means it has been 10'592 days exactly since you started going on about communist Taylor Swift and other favourites of yours. 
  I have only had the pleasure for a short 672 days, so far. In my musings the past weeks, I've come to think of these numbers not only as your hubby, but as a data scientist as well, 
  so I decided to try to show such a perspective for your birthday, using our 672 days of data. But first, let's look at the total days of Tara:</p> 

<div><div id="e9f7313e-6ae2-4e5a-8b0a-2632d09ca3f3" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" class="plotly-graph-div"></div><script type="text/javascript">window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};window.PLOTLYENV.BASE_URL="https://plot.ly";Plotly.newPlot("e9f7313e-6ae2-4e5a-8b0a-2632d09ca3f3", [{"orientation": "h", "y": [""], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "#9C7695"}, "uid": "c0ae375b-41dd-4ce3-8c46-0892d396d6ee", "name": "before", "x": [9920]}, {"orientation": "h", "y": [""], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "#E5A768"}, "uid": "72dfa06e-92c8-4783-8291-b4667575fb4f", "name": "after", "x": [672]}], {"barmode": "stack", "title": {"text": "Days of Tara: before and after hubby"}, "xaxis": {"title": {"text": "# of days of Tara", "font": {"size": 14, "family": "Arial, sans-serif"}}}}, {"plotlyServerURL": "https://plot.ly", "showLink": false, "linkText": "Export to plot.ly"})</script><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("resize", function(){Plotly.Plots.resize(document.getElementById("e9f7313e-6ae2-4e5a-8b0a-2632d09ca3f3"));});</script></div>

<p>Clearly though, a great change has taken place in this comparatively short time! I will allow myself a break from my impeccable coolness to say:
  for this I am eternally grateful, not to Taylor or Karl (who you would claim make you the person I fell in love with) but to yourself, and to Bahá'u'lláh for helping both of us along our paths, that ended up crossing on our fatefully awkward morning walk. This process of course was not an easy one, 
but one in which we were showered with opportunities for growth. You were able to observe the start of the process of transformation in me, as I was with you. Throughout the 672 days, I have seen you embracing
not only myself as your humble hubby, but a new culture as your home. I tried to show this below in 3 rough stages:<ul> <li>the German, when still getting to know each other, adressing essential questions and grappling
with a vision of the immediate future;</li><li> the Hybrid, starting with our engagement, when coming to a realization, although not explicit or conclusive, 
of an impending need to leave the beloved berlinian neighbourhood;</li><li> finally, the Swiss, initiated by our wedding, characterized by a radiant acceptance of the <i>gueti u luschtigi Ziite</i> we now have in <i>üsem neue Dihei</i>.</li></ul> 
 </p>

 <p>So much for a quick overview. Of course -- and this is the challenge of a data scientist's perspective -- the rough numbers only show so much of the content. I tried going a bit more in-depth,
 to understand as best as possible what we have been up to in the bast 672 days.</p>
 <p>To begin with, the easiest, we have actually produced a huge amount of data, by our steady stream of text messages. Of course, you remember that this all started with me bravely taking the first step
   and getting in touch with you over Messenger. Since then, we've been writing mainly over three different chat platforms, going through the phases of getting to know each other, and being awkward about
 saying words like feelings, love and marriage, all the way to reminding each other to buy lemons and toilet paper on the way home. I don't mean to sound sarcastic, I'm actually so grateful, and would happily
fill our apartment to the brim with lemons and toilet paper if that's what our married-life-shopping-list dictated.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm rambling... this shows my nervousness I guess :) So, let's move on to the perspective of..</p>

<h3>Quantity</h3>
  
Let's take a look at the amount of text that has gone back and forth between us in the past 672 days. Something new

<div><div id="31d6f14e-1480-48ce-93c3-bbd327a3ea4e" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" class="plotly-graph-div"></div><script type="text/javascript">window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};window.PLOTLYENV.BASE_URL="https://plot.ly";Plotly.newPlot("31d6f14e-1480-48ce-93c3-bbd327a3ea4e", [{"y": [31717, 38409], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "rgb(0,136,204)"}, "x": ["Alexis", "Tara"], "name": "Telegram", "uid": "2a1d2e1b-a6a8-4aba-8c8f-c85c7d906381"}, {"y": [18350, 22629], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "rgb(18,140,126)"}, "x": ["Alexis", "Tara"], "name": "Whatsapp", "uid": "ad71beb4-119c-4633-b1f7-a6583d416cac"}, {"y": [2009, 2566], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "rgb(255,195,0)"}, "x": ["Alexis", "Tara"], "name": "Messenger", "uid": "43c79242-4f3f-4978-aca0-df5b4b8a2ca8"}], {"barmode": "stack", "title": {"text": "Total message count per platform"}, "yaxis": {"title": {"text": "# of messages sent", "font": {"size": 14, "family": "Arial, sans-serif"}}}}, {"plotlyServerURL": "https://plot.ly", "showLink": false, "linkText": "Export to plot.ly"})</script><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("resize", function(){Plotly.Plots.resize(document.getElementById("31d6f14e-1480-48ce-93c3-bbd327a3ea4e"));});</script></div>

<p>Ok, I guess that looks kind of like expected. I guess most people would say that Tara talks more than Alexis, although, I kind of hoped it wouldn't show this badly. Dearest wife, you are generous in many ways.
This data just shows another one of those, i.e. that you are generous with your words. Full disclosure, I did try other metrics (average word count, total word count), in case somehow I could appear to be generous as well, but all such attempts failed.
<i>Adding generosity to the long list of things I'm learning from you about.</i> </p>

<div><div id="d073b46f-8256-4bf1-9196-8cbd5ee6f2c8" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" class="plotly-graph-div"></div><script type="text/javascript">window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};window.PLOTLYENV.BASE_URL="https://plot.ly";Plotly.newPlot("d073b46f-8256-4bf1-9196-8cbd5ee6f2c8", [{"y": [5.047986884005423, 5.625218047853368], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "rgb(0,136,204)"}, "x": ["Alexis", "Tara"], "name": "Telegram", "uid": "db73845f-3ffb-4855-b371-50d53f8b98a9"}, {"y": [5.082343324250681, 5.267974722700959], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "rgb(18,140,126)"}, "x": ["Alexis", "Tara"], "name": "Whatsapp", "uid": "3dbc9e84-ad09-4493-be44-9642032e3dd3"}, {"y": [5.405674464907914, 5.595089633671083], "type": "bar", "marker": {"color": "rgb(255,195,0)"}, "x": ["Alexis", "Tara"], "name": "Messenger", "uid": "a494c735-a2e3-4a74-96fc-668c92466832"}], {"barmode": "stack", "title": {"text": "Average word count per platform"}, "yaxis": {"title": {"text": "average # of words per message per platform", "font": {"size": 14, "family": "Arial, sans-serif"}}}}, {"plotlyServerURL": "https://plot.ly", "showLink": false, "linkText": "Export to plot.ly"})</script><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("resize", function(){Plotly.Plots.resize(document.getElementById("d073b46f-8256-4bf1-9196-8cbd5ee6f2c8"));});</script></div>

An interesting little side note: while my average has been decreasing over time (remember that we started with Messenger, moved on to Whatsapp and currently use Telegram as our main platform), 
your word count average has actually increased slightly, especially lately on Telegram! So even though we might be sending fewer messages overall, the length of the individual texts from Tara to hubby has increased.

I even checked how our overall messaging looked over the time we have known each other. Below is the plot of our message count, but grouped for one week at a time. 
Here again, husband has to admit that there are only a handful of weeks (roughly 10) where Tara sent fewer messages.

  Ok, so what if we look at the data grouped into days of the week and hours of the day. The result here is kind of worrying, or at least shines a light on some behaviour that hopefully has changed since we first started messaging 
  (notice the clear peak of activity in working hours on weekdays?). For shame, husband... But then again, talking to wife is the best!

So let's pause to recap what we have so far: 
<ol>
  <li>it's Tara's birthday.</li>
  <li>husband prepared a little (data-)love-letter.</li>
  <li>husband and Tara have known each other for 672 days.</li>
  <li>in these 672 days, Tara has 'wins' (although it really isn't a competition) across general metrics</li>
  <li>husband shamefully spends too much time communicating with Tara, while at work...</li>
</ol>
  
Quite conclusive, one might say. And yet, we haven't even started looking at

<h3> the Content</h3>
First of all, I wanted to give an overall representation of the content of our exchanges. This could be done in many ways, one of the most current being word clouds, which are built by taking the most frequent words of a text.
After removing a set of very common English words (called stopwords, e.g. a, of, an, to, for, I, you), we get the following results, first for the messages I have sent you over the past 672 days

and then for the messages you have sent me over the past 672 Days

(of course, as the hopeless romantic hubby is, he couldn't resist the temptation of a reminder of this beautiful <a href="https://semplea.github.io/assets/wedding.jpg">picture</a>).
