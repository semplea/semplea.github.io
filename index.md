Hi everybody!

I apologise in advance. My name is Alexis, I am, among many other things, a computer scientist, and as everyone knows, a good computer scientist writes passionately about his work.

This could be a problem... but I decided to take a swing at it and write down some thoughts and musings that popped into my head. It could be work-related, it could be anything else. If I were a betting man, I would put my money on anything else, disguising itself as being work-related.

I hope you enjoy it. If not, please don't take it out on innocent passersby. _Give them a cookie instead._
